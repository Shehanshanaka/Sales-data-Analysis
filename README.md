# 📊 Supplement Sales Data (2020–2025)
## Overview
This dataset contains weekly sales data for a variety of health and wellness supplements from January 2020 to April 2025. The data includes products in categories like Protein, Vitamins, Omega, and Amino Acids, among others, and covers multiple e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Walmart, and iHerb. The dataset also tracks sales in several locations including the USA, UK, and Canada.
## Insights :
* Which country buys the most products?
* Which country generates the most revenue throughout the years? 
* Which platform has the most customers? 
* Which country returns products more frequently, and what types of products do they return? 
* Should we label more products with discounts by slightly increasing the price and then adding a discount?
This is because people tend to buy more products that are discounted.
